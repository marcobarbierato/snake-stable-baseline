# snake-stable-baseline
`snakeenv.py` contains the definitions for each environment, and `utils.py` contains custom training monitor and feature extracture definitions. `learn.py` is where we train the model, which is saved automatically (by the monitoring callbacks) based on mean rewards per episode. `evaluate.py` loads the model `best_model.zip` and evaluates it. `baseline.ipynb` computes the rewards of the baselines.
